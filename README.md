# Project Title

Movie Recommendation System with Content-Based, Collaborative Filtering, and Popularity-Based Approaches

# Description

This project implements a movie recommendation system using a combination of content-based filtering, collaborative filtering, and popularity-based techniques. It leverages the MovieLens dataset, a widely used benchmark for recommender system evaluation.

# Key Features:

Content-Based Filtering: Recommends movies similar to those a user has rated highly, based on movie features (e.g., genre, director, actors).
Collaborative Filtering: Recommends movies that users with similar tastes have rated highly.
Popularity-Based Recommendations: Recommends movies that have been rated highly by a large number of users overall.
Hybrid Approach: Combines the strengths of content-based and collaborative filtering for more robust recommendations.
Popularity Integration: Leverages popularity data to refine recommendations, potentially highlighting hidden gems.
